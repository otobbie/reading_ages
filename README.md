# Reading_ages
This project suggests a hybrid model of GloVe, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), alongside traditional machine learning algorithms to perform the multi-classification of the reading ages to predict the reading age. The reading ages are numerical classes which range from 6 to 18, where a reading age of 6 means a 6th grader will understand the text and a text with a reading age above 17 will need advanced knowledge and understanding, usually above a college graduate.
